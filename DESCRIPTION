Description: This package generates data vectors Y and X using a simple predictive regression model with no intercept and a single regressor. The regressor follows an AR(1) process with no trend and no intercept. A framework of similar nature was initially studied by Mankiw and Shapiro (1986). For each R function, the predictor's errors are distributed according to a standard normal distribution, whereas the disturbances of the predictive regression are changed according to the function of choice. The degrees of contemporaneous correlaion and persistency of the regressors are nominated the investigator.
