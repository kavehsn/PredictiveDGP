Description: This package generates the data vectors \eqn{y} and \eqn{x} using the predictive regression model \eqn{y_t=\beta+x_{t-1}+\varepsilon_t} for \eqn{t=1,\cdots,T}, in which the regressors follow an AR(1) process \qen{x_t=\theta x_{t-1}+u_t}. This framework was first visited by \insertCite{mankiw1986we,textual}{Rdpack}. For all functions, the predictor's errors are distributed according to \eqn{u_t\sim N(0,1)}, whereas the predictive regression disturbances \eqn{\varepsilon_t} are changed. The intial value of \eqn{x} is generated by \eqn{x_0\frac{w_0}{\sqrt{1-\theta^2}}}, where \eqn{w_t\sim N(0,1)}. Finally, the contemporaneous correlation between the disturbances \eqn{\varepsilon_t} and \eqn{u_t} is captured by \eqn{\rho\varepsilon_t+w_t\sqrt{1-\rho^2}}.
